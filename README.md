# Distributed-MST-pyspark

This is the MSBD 5003 course project. To run the project, please follow these steps:

1. Download the networks dataset from [360YUN](https://yunpan.360.cn/surl_yrmfdmczfpQ). Unzip it and put the `data` folder in project directory.
2. Create a directory `result` which is used to save the final results.
3. run `ParallelMST.py` or follow the `Test.ipynb`. Both are the same.
